The personal Inflation concept tells us how every individual has his/her own inflation rate depending on the amount spent across different categories.

Also, you can choose between "Rural", "Urban" & "Combined" inflation.

Inflation for each category is sourced from RBI and is released every month. The Source of these values for the latest month is shown at the bottom.

This tool is built using Node JS, Angular, MongoDB and deployed on Northflank as a Docker container.
